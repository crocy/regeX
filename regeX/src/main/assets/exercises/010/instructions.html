    Construct a SINGLE regular expression that uses only reptition modifiers (<tt>*</tt>
    and <tt>+</tt>), alternation (<tt>|</tt>), and grouping (
    <tt>(</tt> and <tt>)</tt>) that will determine whether a
    string consists of only 0's and 1's AND that there are the
    SAME number of occurrences of the substring '01' as there
    are '10'.

    <br><br>

    Examples:

    <ul>
    <li> '101' succeeds, because it has ONE '10' and ONE '01'.
    </li><li> '1001' succeeds, because it has ONE '10' and ONE '01'.
    </li><li> '1010' fails, because it has TWO '10's and only ONE '01'.
    </li><li> '10101' succeeds, because it has TWO '10's and TWO '01's.
    </li>
    </ul>
